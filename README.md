## Task 0

1. [How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

   * All stuff about forking was new to me.

   * Not only git status but also git branch can show you where you are (on what branch).

   * The whole idea: why do we need staging area at all. It was a feeling that it could be useful, but not so clear how exactly.

2. [try.github.io](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

   * The fact that we can use `-a` option on `git commit` was new to me. It auto removes deleted files with the commit.
     `git commit -am "Delete stuff"`
     
   * It was nice to hear that merge conflicts aren't that scary, you just need to decide which code to keep. (And where to read about this.)
   
   * Force delete for branch if you don't want this feature anymore. (When `git branch -d bad_feature` is not enough.)
   You can either add the `--force (-f)` option or use `-D` which combines `-d -f` together into one command.
   
## Task 1

1. [Linux Command Line Basics](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud595)

   * All stuff about virtual machine was new to me. It was the first time using VirtualBox and Vagrant. 
   
   * One more interesting thing was thinking about what a shell command really is. How is it similar to, and different from a function in JavaScript.
